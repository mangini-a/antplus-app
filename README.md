# Indoor cycling tool suitable for maintaining a given HR
Object-oriented solution with the goal of making a [Tacx Antenna with ANT+ Connectivity](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/690897) interface with a [Garmin Tacx NEO 3M Smart Trainer](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/885302) and a [Polar H10 Heart Rate Monitor](https://www.polar.com/us-en/sensors/h10-heart-rate-sensor) in order to determine indoor cycling sessions' work pace on the basis of the athlete's detected heart rate.

This is achieved by adjusting the exercise intensity (i.e., the trainer's resistance) according to the gap between the current heart rate and the defined target (e.g., 120 beats per minute), with the latter being specified through an ad hoc control found on the UI.
